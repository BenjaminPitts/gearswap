Gear Swap is a collaboration project by Maher Brikae and Ben Pitts. It is a single page application that allows the user to create, update, and delete data that is dynamically rendered to the page. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, Express and Mongoose. An external API was built with MongoDB to store and fetch data for the application. Collaboration took place by individually working on local branches and then pushing/merging them with the main repository.
